Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

Objective:-
The objecƟve of this project is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented GeneraƟon (RAG) pipeline
using LangChain. The pipeline uses pdf files, processes them for retrieval, and uƟlizes a Large
Language Model (LLM) to generate context-aware responses. The key goals include:
 Document ingesƟon (PDFs)
 Chunking & Embedding for fast retrieval
 SemanƟc search for relevant data retrieval
 LLM integraƟon for response generaƟon

ImplementaƟon
1. Data IngesƟon
 Text File Loading

 TextLoader reads a plain text file (here, I used speech.txt file).
 This data will later be embedded and indexed for retrieval.

 Web Scraping

 Extracts relevant content from a webpage using WebBaseLoader.
 Filters unnecessary secƟons using bs4.SoupStrainer.

 PDF Data ExtracƟon

 PyPDFLoader extracts text from a structured PDF document. This helps us to load pdf
file.

2. Chunking the Documents

 Uses RecursiveCharacterTextSpliƩer to divide large documents into manageable
chunks.
 Chunk Size = 1000 and Overlap = 200 ensures relevant context preservaƟon.

3. Vector Embeddings & Storage

 Here, I Used sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 by huggingfacefor text embeddings.
 Here, I Stored the embeddings in ChromaDB(here I have not assigned any path , so this will
store on ram ) for fast retrieval.

4. Similarity Search (Retrieval)

 Searches for semanƟcally similar document chunks based on the user query.
 Retrieves the most relevant content from ChromaDB by using the query provided by the
user.

5. Large Language Model (LLM) IntegraƟon

 Here, I IniƟalized Llama3-8B model from Groq for response generaƟon.

6. Prompt Engineering & Retrieval

 Defines a prompt template to format context-aware queries.
 Ensures structured input to the LLM for beƩer response generaƟon.
7.Chaining and Retriver:-

 Here I created a chain that combined LLM and Prompt to generate a context-aware
response.
 Combines retrieved context with user query.

8. Retrieval Chain:-

 Here , I created retrieval chain by impoƟng create_retrieval_chain that combines above
retriever and document_chain for generaƟng responses based on input:-
 Here I given input :- {"input":"What is visual instrucƟon tuning in LLaVa"}

Output:-

"Based on the provided context, visual instrucƟon tuning in LLaV (Large Language and Vision
Assistant) refers to the process of improving the model's instrucƟon-following abiliƟes using
machine-generated instrucƟon-following data that combines language and images. This is
different from visual prompt tuning, which aims to improve the parameter-efficiency in
model adaptaƟon.\n\nIn the context of LLaV, visual instrucƟon tuning involves generaƟng
mulƟmodal language-image instrucƟon-following data using a language-only GPT-4 model,
and then using this data to fine-tune the LLaV model. The goal of visual instrucƟon tuning is
to effecƟvely leverage the capabiliƟes of both the pre-trained LLM (large language model)
and visual model, enabling the LLaV model to perform well in mulƟmodal tasks such as visual
quesƟon answering and mulƟmodal chat."

Working Process
1. Data CollecƟon: Text files, web pages, and PDFs are ingested.
2. Processing & Chunking: Documents are split into smaller segments.
3. Embedding & Storage: Text embeddings are created and stored in ChromaDB.
4. Retrieval: Searches for the most relevant documents based on the query.
5. LLM IntegraƟon: Retrieved data is used to generate an accurate and informed response.

Result
 Successfully retrieves relevant informaƟon using semanƟc search.
 Enhances LLM responses by grounding them in retrieved knowledge.
 Demonstrates a working Retrieval-Augmented GeneraƟon (RAG) pipeline.

Conclusion
This RAG pipeline successfully integrates document retrieval and LLM-powered generaƟon,
improving response accuracy. The combinaƟon of LangChain, ChromaDB, Hugging Face embeddings,
and Groq LLM ensures an efficient and scalable retrieval-augmented generaƟon system.
