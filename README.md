Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

Objective:-
The objective of this project is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain. The pipeline uses pdf files, processes them for retrieval, and utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate context-aware responses. The key goals include:
•	Document ingestion (PDFs)
•	Chunking & Embedding for fast retrieval
•	Semantic search for relevant data retrieval
•	LLM integration for response generation

Implementation
1. Data Ingestion
	Text File Loading
 
•	TextLoader reads a plain text file (here, I used speech.txt file).
•	This data will later be embedded and indexed for retrieval.

	Web Scraping
 
•	Extracts relevant content from a webpage using WebBaseLoader.
•	Filters unnecessary sections using bs4.SoupStrainer.


	PDF Data Extraction
 
•	PyPDFLoader extracts text from a structured PDF document. This helps us to load pdf file.

2. Chunking the Documents
 
•	Uses RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to divide large documents into manageable chunks.
•	Chunk Size = 1000 and Overlap = 200 ensures relevant context preservation.

3. Vector Embeddings & Storage
 
•	Here, I Used sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 by huggingfacefor text embeddings.
•	Here, I Stored the embeddings in ChromaDB(here I have not assigned any path , so this will store on ram ) for fast retrieval.
________________________________________
4. Similarity Search (Retrieval)
 
•	Searches for semantically similar document chunks based on the user query.
•	Retrieves the most relevant content from ChromaDB  by using the query provided by the user.

5. Large Language Model (LLM) Integration
 
•	Here, I Initialized  Llama3-8B model from Groq for response generation.

6. Prompt Engineering & Retrieval
 
•	Defines a prompt template to format context-aware queries.
•	Ensures structured input to the LLM for better response generation.
 7.Chaining and Retriver:-
 
•	Here I created a chain that combined LLM  and Prompt to generate a context-aware response.
•	Combines retrieved context with user query.

8.  Retrieval Chain:-
 
•	Here , I created retrieval chain by impoting create_retrieval_chain that combines above retriever and document_chain for generating responses based on input:-
•	 Here I given input :- {"input":"What is visual instruction tuning in LLaVa"}

Output:-
 
"Based on the provided context, visual instruction tuning in LLaV (Large Language and Vision Assistant) refers to the process of improving the model's instruction-following abilities using machine-generated instruction-following data that combines language and images. This is different from visual prompt tuning, which aims to improve the parameter-efficiency in model adaptation.\n\nIn the context of LLaV, visual instruction tuning involves generating multimodal language-image instruction-following data using a language-only GPT-4 model, and then using this data to fine-tune the LLaV model. The goal of visual instruction tuning is to effectively leverage the capabilities of both the pre-trained LLM (large language model) and visual model, enabling the LLaV model to perform well in multimodal tasks such as visual question answering and multimodal chat."

Working Process
1.	Data Collection: Text files, web pages, and PDFs are ingested.
2.	Processing & Chunking: Documents are split into smaller segments.
3.	Embedding & Storage: Text embeddings are created and stored in ChromaDB.
4.	Retrieval: Searches for the most relevant documents based on the query.
5.	LLM Integration: Retrieved data is used to generate an accurate and informed response.

Result
•	Successfully retrieves relevant information using semantic search.
•	Enhances LLM responses by grounding them in retrieved knowledge.
•	Demonstrates a working Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.
