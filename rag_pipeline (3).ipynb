GST has \\nreplaced a number of Central and State taxes, made India more of a national integrated market, \\nand brought more producers into the tax net. By improving efficiency, it can add substantially to \\ngrowth as well as government finances. Implementing a new tax, encompassing both goods and \\nservices, by the Centre and the States in a large and complex federal system, is perhaps unprece-\\ndented in modern global tax history.\\nGST is a tax on goods and services with comprehensive and continuous chain of set-off benefits \\nup to the retailer level. It is essentially a tax only on value addition at each stage, and a supplier at \\neach stage is permitted to set-off, through a tax credit mechanism, the GST paid on the purchase \\nof goods and services. Ultimately, the burden of GST is borne by the end-user (i.e. final consumer) \\nof the commodity/service.\\nWith the introduction of GST, a continuous chain of set-off from the original producer’s point and \\nservice provider’s point up to the retailer’s level has been established, eliminating the burden of all \\ncascading or pyramiding effects of an indirect tax system. This is the essence of GST. GST taxes \\nonly the final consumer. Hence the cascading of taxes (tax-on-tax) is avoided and production costs \\nare cut down.\\nAs already noted, prior to the introduction of GST, the indirect tax system of India suffered from \\nvarious limitations. There was a burden of tax-on-tax in the pre-GST system of Central excise duty \\nand the sales tax system of the States. GST has taken under its wings a profusion of indirect taxes \\nof the Centre and the States. It has integrated taxes on goods and services for set-off relief. Further, \\nit has also captured certain value additions in the distributive trade. There is now a continuous \\nchain of set-offs which would eliminate the burden of all cascading effects.\\nPresently, services sector in India constitutes a tax base with vast potential which has not been \\nexploited as yet. It is in this context that GST is justified as it has subsumed under it almost all the \\nservices for the purpose of taxation. Since major Central and State indirect taxes have got subsumed \\nunder GST, the multiplicity of taxes has been substantially reduced which, in turn, would decrease \\nthe operating costs of the country’s tax system. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across \\nthe country will go a long way in reducing compliance costs.\\nIn a nutshell, GST is a comprehensive indirect tax levy on manufacture, sale and consumption of \\ngoods as well as services at the national level. GST is an indirect tax for the whole of India to make \\nit one unified common market. GST is designed to give India a world class tax system and improve \\ntax collections. It would end the long-standing distortions of differential treatment of manufacturing \\nsector and services sector. GST will facilitate seamless credit across the entire supply chain and \\nacross all States under a common tax base.\\n 9'),\n",

There-\\nafter, the Task Force on Implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, \\n2003 (Chairman: vijay Kelkar) recommended the removal of all inefficient and distortionary taxes \\nso that India obtains the efficiencies of a single national tax, and suggested a comprehensive GST \\nbased on vAT principle. The idea of moving towards a GST was proposed in 2005 by the then Union \\nFinance Minister, P. Chidambaram in his budget speech for the year 2005-06 where he observed \\nthat the entire production-distribution chain should be covered by a goods and services tax that \\nencompasses both the Centre and the States. He reiterated his idea in 2006-07 budget speech and \\nproposed April 1, 2010 as the date for introducing GST. Towards this objective, an Empowered \\nCommittee (EC) of State Finance Ministers was to work with the Central Government to prepare a \\nroadmap for introduction of GST. The final version of the report of EC was presented in the form \\nof ‘A Model and Roadmap for Goods and Services Tax in India’ on April 30, 2008.\\nAfter receiving comments on the report from Government of India and concerned officials of the State \\nGovernments and taking into account their recommendations, the EC released the First Discussion \\npaper on Goods and Services Tax in India on November 10, 2009 to obtain the inputs of industry, \\ntrade bodies, and people at large. on 22nd March 2011, the Constitution (115th Amendment) Bill \\nwas introduced in the Lok Sabha to operationalize the GST and enable Centre and States to make \\nlaws for levying of GST. However, the Bill lapsed with the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha. There-\\nafter, on 19th December, 2014 the Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, 2014 was introduced in the \\nLok Sabha to address various issues related to GST. It is noteworthy that the introduction of GST \\nrequired a Constitutional amendment as the Constitution did not vest express power either in the \\nCentral Government or State Government to levy tax on the ‘supply of goods and services’. While \\nthe Centre was empowered to tax services and goods up to the production stage, the States had the \\npower to tax sale of goods. Since the GST regime requires goods and services to be simultaneously \\ntaxed by both the Central and State Governments, a Constitutional amendment was needed.\\nThe Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, 2014 was passed by the Lok Sabha on 6th May, 2015 after \\nwhich the Rajya Sabha passed the Bill with 9 amendments on 3rd August, 2016. The Lok Sabha \\nthen passed the modified Bill on 8th August, 2016. After getting approval of half of the States, it \\nwas sent to the President for his assent which was given on 8th September, 2016. Thus the road to \\nGST rollout was cleared and the process of enactment was completed.\\n2.2 Salient Features of GST in India\\nThe salient features of GST in India have been highlighted below:\\n 1. supply as the base: GST would be applicable on “supply” of goods or services as against the \\nerstwhile concept of tax on the manufacture of goods or on sale of goods or on provision \\nof services.\\n 2. destination-based tax: As opposed to the previous principle of origin-based taxation, GST \\nwould be based on the principle of destination-based consumption taxation.\\n 3. dual GsT: The Centre and the States would simultaneously levy tax on a common base. \\nThe GST to be levied by the Centre would be called Central GST (CGST) and the GST to be \\nlevied by the States (including Union territories with legislature) would be called State GST \\n(SGST). Union territories without legislature would levy Union territory GST (UTGST).\\n 4. inter-state supply: An integrated GST (IGST) would be levied on inter-State supply of goods \\nor services. This would be collected by the Centre so that the credit chain is not disrupted. \\nImports of goods and services would be treated as inter-State supplies and would be subject \\nto IGST. (This would be in addition to applicable customs duties).\\nPara 2.2 INTRoDUCTIoN To GST 10'),\n",

GST on five specified petroleum products (crude, petrol, diesel, aviation turbine fuel, \\nnatural gas) would be applicable from a date to be recommended by the GST Council.\\n 8. Threshold for GsT: A common threshold exemption would apply to both CGST and SGST. \\nTaxpayers with an annual turnover of ` 20 lakh (` 10 lakh for special category States (ex-\\ncept J&K) as specified in article 279A of the Constitution) would be exempt from GST. A \\ncompounding option (i.e. to pay tax at a flat rate without credits) would be available to small \\ntaxpayers (including to manufacturers other than specified category of manufacturers and \\nservice providers) having an annual turnover of up to ` 1 crore (` 75 lakh for special category \\nStates (except J&K and Uttarakhand) enumerated in article 279A of the Constitution). The \\nthreshold exemption and compounding scheme is optional.\\n 9. exports: All exports and supplies to Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and SEZ units would \\nbe zero-rated.\\n 10. input tax credit: Credit of CGST paid on inputs may be used only for paying CGST on the \\noutput and the credit of SGST/UTGST paid on inputs may be used only for paying SGST/\\nUTGST. In other words, the two streams of input tax credit (ITC) cannot be cross utilized, \\nexcept in specified circumstances of inter-State supplies for payment of IGST. (For details, \\nsee the Chapter on Input Tax Credit).\\n 11. electronic filing of returns: There will be electronic filing of returns by different class of \\npersons at different cut-off dates. various modes of payment of tax available to the taxpay-\\ner including internet banking, debit/credit card and National Electronic Funds Transfer \\n(NEFT)/Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS).\\n 12. Tax deduction on payment made: While the provision for TDS has not been notified yet, it \\nis obligatory on certain persons including government departments, local authorities and \\ngovernment agencies, who are recipients of supply, to deduct tax at the rate of 1% from the \\npayment made or credited to the supplier where total value of supply, under a contract, \\nexceeds ` 2,50,000.\\n 13. Tax collection at source by e-commerce operators: While the provision for TCS has not been \\nnotified yet,it is obligatory for electronic commerce operators to collect ‘tax at source’, at \\nsuch rate not exceeding 2% of net value of taxable supplies, out of payments to suppliers \\nsupplying goods or services through their portals.\\n 14. refund: Refund of tax can be sought by taxpayer or by any other person who has borne \\nthe incidence of tax within two years from the relevant date. Refund is to be granted within \\n60 days from the date of receipt of complete application and interest is payable if refund is \\nnot sanctioned within 60 days.\\n 15. anti-profiteering clause: An anti-profiteering clause has been provided in order to ensure \\nthat business passes on the benefit of reduced tax incidence on goods or services or both to \\nthe consumers.\\n11 SALIENT FEATURES oF GST IN INDIA Para 2.2'),\n",

By ensuring uniformity of indirect tax rates across \\nthe country, it will substantially improve the ease of doing business.\\n 2. elimination of cascading effect: Under GST, provision of seamless input tax credit across \\ntransactions will avoid tax cascading, eliminate double taxation and improve resource allo-\\ncation.\\n 3. efficiency: Subsuming of all major indirect taxes will result in the removal of inefficient \\ntaxes. With as single tax to be paid, manufacturers will become more competitive and this \\ncould lead to growth in exports.\\n 4. reduced compliance costs: Harmonisation of tax rates and laws along with seamless input \\ntax credits and a sound IT infrastructure is expected to lead to reduced compliance costs.\\nAs all the taxpayer services like registrations, payments, returns etc. will be available online, \\nthe compliance process would become simpler.\\n 5. reduction in tax evasion: Uniform rates of taxation would reduce the incentive for tax \\nevasion by eliminating rate arbitrage opportunities between neighbouring states and that \\nbetween intra-State and inter-State sales.\\n 6. improved collection efficiency: GST is also desirable from the point of view of tax policy and \\ncollection. Even if the taxes are lowered, the revenue of the Union and the states is expected \\nto be buoyant due to less evasion. A single rate across all goods and services will eliminate \\nclassification disputes and make tax assessment more predictable. Harmonisation of tax \\nassessment, levy and collection procedures across states will reduce compliance costs, limit \\nevasion, enhance transparency and improve collection efficiency.\\n 7. revenue generation: By controlling tax leakage from the system and having a wider base, \\nGST would generate more tax revenues for both the Central and State Governments.\\n 8. encourages savings and investment: As GST is a tax on consumption and not on income, \\nso the tax system inherently encourages savings and investments instead of consumption. \\nFurther, input tax credit would lead to a decrease in the cost of capital goods and provide \\nboost to investments.\\n 9. improved efficiency of logistics : Due to GST implementation, the restriction on inter-State \\nmovement of goods is likely to be lessened and the logistics sector is anticipated to start con-\\nsolidating warehouses across the country. In the erstwhile indirect tax structure, decisions \\nrelated to logistics and distribution centres were based on tax considerations as opposed to \\noperational efficiency. With GST in place, these decisions will now be based on operational \\nefficiency and warehouses would be set up at locations that would help in reaching custom-\\ners faster and reduce costs.\\n 10. regulation of the unorganized sector : For a large unorganized sector that exists in business, \\nGST has provisions for online compliances and payments, and availing of input credit only \\nwhen the supplier has accepted the amount, thereby bringing accountability and regulation \\nto these businesses.\\n 11. export competitiveness : With GST in place, the export industry in India would be able to \\nhave internationally competitive prices due to the smooth process of claiming input tax \\ncredit and the availability of input tax credit on services. The exports of goods or services \\nwould be a zero rated supply under GST implying that GST would not be levied on export \\nof goods or services. All this, in turn, would provide a push to government’s ‘Make in India’ \\ncampaign.\\nPara 2.3 INTRoDUCTIoN To GST 12'),\n",

Similarly, for service tax, service providers with turnover less than ` 10 lakhs \\nare exempted. Under GST this threshold has been increased to ` 20 lakhs thus exempting \\nmany small traders and service providers.\\n 13. composition scheme for small businesses: The composition scheme under the GST regime is \\na method of levy of tax designed for small taxpayers whose turnover is up to ` 1 crore (` 75 \\nlakhs in case of 9 Special Category States). Those who opt for this scheme can file returns \\non a quarterly basis unlike the others who have to file returns on a monthly basis. Under \\nthe scheme, small businesses, manufacturers and restaurants will be subject to a GST rate \\nof 0.5%, 1% and 2.5% respectively on turnover. The Composition scheme has been designed \\nto simplify and reduce the burden of compliance for smaller taxpayers.\\n 14. benefits to consumers: The final price of goods is expected to be lower due to seamless flow \\nof input tax credit between the manufacturer, retailer and supplier of services. Average tax \\nburden on companies is likely to come down which is expected to reduce prices and hence \\nbenefit the consumer.\\n2.4 Concerns regarding GST\\n 1. lack of preparedness: The understanding of the provisions of GST is still at a nascent stage \\nfor many people engaged in business. They are still trying to assess the mandated GST \\ncompliance provisions that their relevant functional departments (such as IT Department, \\nLegal department) need to adhere to.\\n 2. compliance related issues: Businesses need to file multiple returns which may increase \\nmanifold in accordance with business models. Clients will need to ensure timely compliance \\nby registered suppliers to ensure there is no loss of input credit. This will necessitate correct \\ndata and reports to fill accurate GST returns.\\n 3. increased costs due to software purchase: Businesses have to either update their existing \\naccounting or ERP software to a GST-compliant software or buy a GST software so that they \\ncan keep their business going. Both the options lead to increased cost of software purchase \\nand training of employees for an efficient utilization of the new billing software.\\n 4. small businesses: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) who have not yet signed \\nfor GST have to quickly grasp the nuances of the GST tax regime. They will have to issue \\nGST-complaint invoices, be compliant to digital record-keeping, and of course, file timely \\nreturns. This means that the GST-complaint invoice issued must have mandatory details \\nsuch as GSTIN, place of supply, HSN codes, and others.\\n 5. lack of skilled resources and re-skilling existing workforce: As GST has been introduced \\nrecently, skilled staff with complete and updated subject knowledge of GST is not easily \\navailable. This has resulted in an urgent need for adequate skilled human resources well- \\nversed with GST to ensure swift implementation. In addition, businesses will need to re-train \\ntheir employees in GST compliance, further increasing their overhead expenses.\\n 6. multiple rate structure: The GST presently has a four slab structure with tax rates kept \\nat 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. The multiple tax structure has been justified on the ground that \\nnecessary items of mass consumption should be taxed at a lower rate while luxury items \\nshould be taxed at higher rates. However, multiple rates are likely to increase administra-\\ntive complexity as well as create classification disputes. Such a system makes it difficult to \\nevaluate the overall effects of the tax design.\\n13 CoNCERNS REGARDING GST Para 2.4'),\n",
